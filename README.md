# 🥗 AI-Based Nutrition Planner

An AI-powered web application that provides personalized meal and nutrition recommendations based on user input such as age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, weight gain, or maintenance). Built with a frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a Python backend (Flask) integrated with a machine learning model.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-driven meal recommendations
- 🔍 Nutrient and calorie estimation
- 📊 Visual nutrient breakdown using charts
- 🧾 Personalized dietary plans
- 🔗 API-based architecture for easy integration
- 🌐 Responsive web interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Fetch API)

### Backend
- Python 3
- Flask
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Nutrition Dataset (Kaggle/USDA)

### Optional
- Chart.js (for nutrient graphs)
- SQLite or Firebase (for user data storage)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User enters their profile (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, goal).
2. Frontend sends this data to the backend using JavaScript Fetch API.
3. Flask backend receives the data and runs a trained ML model to:
   - Estimate daily calorie requirement
   - Recommend a list of meals matching the dietary goal
4. The response is displayed on the frontend dynamically with nutrition breakdown.

## 🧠 AI/ML Functionality

- Trained a simple Decision Tree / KNN model using a nutrition dataset (foods, calories, macronutrients).
- Features considered: Age, gender, BMI, activity level, and goal.
- Labels: Meal clusters optimized for goal (e.g., weight loss meals, high-protein meals).
